A non-functional design for a Reddit Crawler created for an interview process design test.

> ## Design a Reddit Crawler
> We want to allow our users to easily access information that matters to them, even though their days are packed, and time is short to search all the different categories manually.
> 
> Design a website that allows users to stay up to date in their areas of interest (e.g. news, movies, music) in a glimpse. Use reddit channels as the source for information. The page should be available through a simple web-interface that can be accessed on desktop as well as from mobile devices. Also, think of additional features that help finding the right articles/posts fast or would improve the website in general.
> 
> Use these channels for your mockups:
> * News: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/
> * Technology: https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/
> * Funny: https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/
> 
> ### Technical aspect:
> * Use any design tool of your preference
> * Use an existing design system of your choice for your designs
> * Create a prototype and share it with us
> * If youâ€™re unsure about something or need more specs, just improvise. You have the freedom.
> * Do not spend more than half a day on this task.
